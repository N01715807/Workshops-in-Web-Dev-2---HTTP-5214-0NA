Hello everyone my project is the Procrastination Excuse Machine it looks like a funny machine when you type words like deadline or crash the machine spits out a paper with an excuse you can copy it or save it as an image with a Filmithub mark there are two modes one uses my small library of excuses and the other asks AI for new ones I build it with HTML CSS JavaScript and a Python backend the goal is to practice web and AI and also make people laugh thank you
